### 1. [colorGame  ->JavaScript](https://mohibullahkamal.github.io/myProjects/)

This project was build to practice my VanillaJS and jQuery skills. No frameworks or libraries were used. This is a RGB color game where players have to guess the color after mixing three color values (Red, Green, Blue).
